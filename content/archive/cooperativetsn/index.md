{{< meta-info >}}

This page is still under construction.   
In the future (latest with camera ready version) it will contain references to:
- the documentation of the simulation
- the repository with the code used for this paper
- implementation details of the paper
- the simulations results
- and the analysis scripts to reproduce everything.



## Simulation
The simulation is based on OMNeT++, INET, Veins, SUMO and TSNsched.
